                        <p>There are men who are born with the ability to communicate with the gods. In ancient times
                            they
                            were
                            called prophets, nowadays they are called schizoids.</p>

                        <p>This page aims to rehabilitate the controversial figure of HR, so often reduced to a madman,
                            he
                            was
                            much
                            more than that: a voice of a generation, a spiritual leader and, fundamentally, a figure
                            that
                            transcends culture as we know it.</p>

                        <p class="subtitle"> I Against I</p>

                        <p>
                            Arguably one of the main revolutionary threats of the 1980s, the influence that HR has on
                            the
                            counter-culture is a reflection of the contradictions of a man who can be seen as a martyr
                            and
                            messiah of transgression.</p>
                        <p>Fueled by HR's psychic energy, the hardcore punk scene flourished while HR's state of mind
                            languished. In those troubled moments, he sought to calm his tumultuous spirit through
                            of communion with Jah. </p>

                        <p>In yet another transgression, HR and his companions, in addition to
                            offering a cathartic and quintessential hardcore punk experience, give us the paradoxical
                            and
                            brooding reggae, with a strangely lucid HR clinging to a ray of reason </p>
                        <p>But all in vain. It was too late, HR took the path of the prophets, with his "hunting rod"
                            which,
                            not coincidentally, served as his acronym, later changed to "human rights". Thus, holding
                            his
                            hunting rod, he destroyed the desert
                            of the real and with it the last things that connected him to the material world. And so, he
                            abandoned the real, exchanging it for divine wisdom and the punishment of never being
                            understood
                            again.</p>
